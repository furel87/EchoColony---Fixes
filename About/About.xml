Have you ever wondered what your colonists think about their daily lives?
Their relationships, that scar that never healed, their last breakup… or that human leather throne in the dining room?

With EchoColony, you can talk to them directly.
💬 Their responses aren’t random — they reflect what they’ve lived, how they feel, and what they remember.

Your colonists reply like real people.
Want them to address you as a king? A god? A curious visitor? You decide.
Configure their tone globally or individually.

Give one a French accent?
Make another obsessed with human leather armchairs?
Yes — you can do that too.

Colonists always take into account their backstory, mood, pain, relationships, and recent events when responding.
You can choose between two styles:
• ✨ Roleplay mode: immersive, expressive replies with gestures and emotional nuance.
• 🗣️ Direct mode: clear and concise, focused on conversation.

Because even the quietest human-leather tanner has something to say.
