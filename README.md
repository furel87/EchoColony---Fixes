## 🔧 Development Status

This project represents an early exploration into AI-powered RimWorld modding. As my first venture into mod development, the codebase contains:

- **Mixed documentation** in both English and Spanish
- **Experimental implementations** that evolved during development
- **Learning-oriented architecture** that prioritized functionality over optimization

While the mod is fully functional and tested, contributors should expect to encounter varied coding styles and documentation approaches. This authentic development history is preserved to show the iterative nature of modding and learning.

**Future improvements welcome** - including code refactoring, documentation standardization, and architectural enhancements.
